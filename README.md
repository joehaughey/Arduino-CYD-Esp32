Accurate Frequency Meter

simply download the sketch and follow the Arduino ide using ESP32 Dev environment
you may have to unplug the usb and reinsert, 

you won't see the waterfall or the frequency in hertz binary and hexadecimal until,  you connect the extended io,  in my case a blue dupont wire,  the blue one is the input and the other the RX,  the two other dupont wires are powering an external connection,  but in our case we only want the Frequency of a Signal not a lot of 555 timer sensors,  though they are possable

to recap  place the code in the arduino ide
make sure you look at the parameters and that you are using the correct usb port.  Make sure you are using the esp32 dev kit in the arduino,  undertools
